            <h5>Do white Holes Exist? <br> In theory, a white hole looks similar to a black hole, but instead of sucking matter in, a white hole pushes matter away.This image is From Nasa, could this really be a a white hole? White holes were long thought to be a figment of general relativity born from the same equations as their collapsed star brethren, black holes.</h5>

                <h5> A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.<br> Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars.

                <h5>As you can see we have less information about White Holes as they are just myths for we don't know wether they are real or not, we know that black holes exist for the energy getting pulled in by a black hole. </h5>
                <br>
                <h5>Albert Einstein and Karl Schwarzschild discoverd Black Holes In 1916 Albert predicted the existence of black holes, with his general theory of relativity. The term "black hole" was coined many years later in 1967 by American astronomer John Wheeler. After decades of black holes being known only as theoretical objects, the first physical black hole ever discovered was spotted in 1971.<br> On the other hand, the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958.</h5>
